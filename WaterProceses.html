            <h2>Water and Landform Processes in Colombia</h2>
            <p>Colombia experiences significant chemical weathering, especially in its mountainous regions where high humidity and rainfall encourage processes like carbonation and hydrolysis. These reactions break down rocks such as limestone and feldspar, contributing to soil formation and slope instability. The country is also highly prone to mass wasting, particularly landslides, due to its rugged topography, intense seasonal rains, and human activities like deforestation and unregulated construction. It is a common thing when traveling between cities in the highway to see landslides blocking the highways.</p>
            <p>One of the most devastating events occurred in Mocoa, Putumayo in March 2017, when heavy rains triggered a massive landslide and flash flood that destroyed parts of the city. Over 300 people were killed, and thousands were displaced. In response, the Colombian government, through the Unidad Nacional para la Gestión del Riesgo de Desastres (UNGRD), implemented a series of risk reduction measures. These included the construction of early warning systems, evacuation protocols, and slope stabilization projects. Additionally, more robust land-use planning policies have been introduced in high-risk zones to prevent future disasters.</p>

            <p>While Colombia is known for its rainforests and mountains, it is also home to two significant desert regions: La Guajira Desert in the northeast and the Tatacoa Desert in the central southwest. These deserts, though relatively small in area, play unique roles in Colombia’s climate, culture, and land use.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>La Guajira Desert is Colombia’s largest desert, located in the La Guajira Peninsula near the Caribbean coast. It is characterized by erg (sand dune) landscapes along the coast and reg (stony plains) further inland. This desert is home to the Wayuu people, who have adapted to its harsh conditions. However, this region is severely affected by aridity, water scarcity, and poor infrastructure. Desertification here is an emerging concern due to overgrazing, deforestation, and climate change, which threaten traditional livelihoods and biodiversity.</li>
                <li>Tatacoa Desert, located in Huila Department, is more accurately described as a dry tropical forest that resembles a desert due to its arid climate and rugged appearance. It features striking hamada-like terrain with eroded rock formations, dry canyons, and clay-based soil. The Tatacoa region receives more rainfall than a true desert but still struggles with soil degradation and limited vegetation.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Although desertification is not widespread across Colombia, localized areas, especially in La Guajira, are experiencing worsening conditions due to unsustainable land use. The Colombian government and NGOs have launched reforestation, water access, and sustainable grazing projects to combat land degradation and support indigenous communities.</p>

            <p>Colombia, despite being located near the equator, has tropical glaciers thanks to its high-altitude peaks in the Andes Mountains. These glaciers, both ancient and current, have played a major role in shaping Colombia’s topography, hydrology, and ecosystems.</p>
            <div class="image-column zoom-hover">
                <img src="Images/NevadoDelRuiz.jpeg" alt="Nevado Del Ruiz" />
            </div>
            <p>Currently, Colombia has six major glaciers found on volcanoes such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Nevado del Ruiz</li>
                <li>Nevado del Huila</li>
                <li>Nevado del Tolima</li>
                <li>Nevado de Santa Isabel</li>
                <li>Nevado del Cocuy</li>
                <li>Nevado del Cumbal</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These glaciers are rapidly retreating due to climate change. According to IDEAM, Colombia has lost over 60% of its glacier coverage since the 1980s, and some glaciers may completely disappear within the next 30 years if warming trends continue. Ancient glacial activity carved U-shaped valleys, left behind moraines, and helped shape the river systems of the Andes. Many headwaters of Colombian rivers originate from glacial melt, making these glaciers crucial for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Freshwater supply in rural and agricultural zones</li>
                <li>Irrigation systems</li>
                <li>Hydroelectric generation</li>
                <li>Biodiversity and paramo ecosystems</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Rivers, Deltas, and Flooding</h2>
            <p>Colombia has many rivers that are important for it's ecosystems, agriculture, transportation, energy, and communities. Most of these rivers are permanent, fed by rainfall, glacial melt, and high-altitude streams.</p>

            <p>Frequent flooding, especially during La Niña years, affects river valleys like those near Barranquilla and Cali. The government has responded with flood control infrastructure and community preparedness initiatives led by UNGRD. Flood monitoring has improved thanks to satellite imagery and local alerts.</p>
            <p>Colombian Major rivers are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Magdalena River, is one of the most important rivers in colombia it is approximately 1,528 km long it supports trade, irrigation, fishing, and hydroelectric power. It flows into the Caribbean Sea and Starts at the Colombian Andes in the Huila Department.</li>
                <li>The Cauca River, is the major tributary of the Magdalena river. It starts in the Central Andes and Discharge into the Magdalena River. it is approximately 965 km long.</li>
                <li>Amazon River, it supports Indigenous communities, biodiversity, and forest ecosystems in Colombia's Amazon region. It starts in the Peruvian Andes, entering to Colombia in the Amazonic region. it flows into Brazil.</li>
                <li>The Oricnoco River, Supports the Llanos (plains) ecosystem and is key for regional trade. It joins the Orinoco Basin in Venezuela</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Trade Routes and Geology</h2>
            <p>Colombian trade routes has many options as well as challenges. Due to the many mountanins and because the country is divided by three branches of the Andes. The transportation is a little complicated.</p>
            <p>Major Land Trade Routes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Pan-American Highway (Carretera Panamericana): It is a highway that goes from the border in Ecuador through cities like Pasto, Cali, Medellin and Bogota. It is offen affected by landslides and earthquakes. Also, the road maintenance is costly in mountains regions. It connects Colombia with international trade across south america.</li>
                <li>Sun Route (Ruta del Sol): It is a route that connects Bogota to the Caribbean ports of Santa Marta, Cartagena, and Barranquilla. This rode is not as long as the Pan-American route. However, this route goes across areas prone to erosion and flooding.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Colombia’s main trade routes follow natural geological corridors. The Magdalena River has historically served as an inland waterway connecting Bogotá to the coast. The Pan-American Highway traverses mountainous terrain, often challenged by landslides and poor infrastructure.</p>

            <p>The Main trading Partnerts are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>United States: US$13.9 billion (28.1% of total Colombian exports)</li>
                <li>Panama: $4.6 billion (9.3%)</li>
                <li>mainland China: $2.5 billion (5%)</li>
                <li>India: $2.4 billion (4.8%)</li>
                <li>Netherlands: $2.04 billion (4.1%)</li>
                <li>Ecuador: $2.01 billion (4.1%)</li>
                <li>Brazil: $1.89 billion (3.8%)</li>
                <li>Mexico: $1.88 billion (3.8%)</li>
                <li>Spain: $1.2 billion (2.3%)</li>
                <li>Peru: $1.1 billion (2.3%)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The countries causing Colombia's largest trade deficits are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>mainland China: -US$11.1 billion (country-specific trade deficit in 2023)</li>
                <li>United States of America: -$2.3 billion</li>
                <li>Brazil: -$2.2 billion</li>
                <li>France: -$1.81 billion</li>
                <li>Germany: -$1.76 billion</li>
                <li>Mexico: -$1.2 billion</li>
                <li>Argentina: -$1.1 billion</li>
                <li>Vietnam: -$800.9 million</li>
                <li>Japan: -$683.9 million</li>
                <li>Canada: -$377.2 million</li>
