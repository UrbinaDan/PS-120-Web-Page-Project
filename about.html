    <p><strong>My Ties to Colombia:</strong> I was born in Colombia and have lived in several regions, including Bogotá and Medellín.</p>
    <p><strong>Interesting Physical Feature:</strong> One fascinating feature of Colombia is the Andes Mountains, which split into three distinct ranges within the country and shape the climate and settlement patterns.</p>
    <p><strong>Spiritual Reflection:</strong> The beauty and complexity of Colombia's landscapes—its jungles, rivers, and mountains—testify to me of a Supreme Creator, as Alma 30:44 teaches. Nature’s harmony reveals divine purpose.</p>
