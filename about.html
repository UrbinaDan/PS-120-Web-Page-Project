            <ul>
              <li>Colombia is located on the continent of South America, in the northwestern corner of the continent. It borders the Caribbean Sea to the north and the Pacific Ocean to the west, sharing land borders with Panama, Venezuela, Brazil, Peru, and Ecuador.</li>

            <ul>
              <li>Colombia lies between approximately 12°N and 4°S latitude, straddling the Equator, which contributes to its tropical climate and biodiversity. Its longitudinal range is roughly 67°W to 79°W.</li>

            <h2>Historical Timeline</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>The Republic of Colombia was officially established in 1810 following its independence movement from Spanish colonial rule. Before that, it was part of the Viceroyalty of New Granada (established in 1717 under Spanish rule). The modern nation of Colombia emerged after the dissolution of Gran Colombia in 1831, which had included Venezuela, Ecuador, and Panama.</li>

            <h2>Famous Cartographers and Influence on Mapping</h2>
            <p>Although Colombia does not have many internationally famous cartographers from its early post-colonial period, the country was heavily influenced by European explorers and mapmakers during the colonial era.</p>
            <h3>Agustín Codazzi (1793–1859)</h3>
            <p>One of the most influential cartographers in Colombian history was Giovanni Battista Agustín Codazzi, an Italian geographer and cartographer who worked in Colombia during the 19th century.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>He is best known for conducting the first official geographic and statistical survey of Colombia, known as the “Atlas Geográfico e Histórico de la República de Colombia”.</li>
              <li>Codazzi played a key role in founding the National Geographic Institute of Colombia, which was later named in his honor.</li>
              <li>His work laid the foundations for modern cartography and regional planning in Colombia.</li>

          <p>One fascinating feature of Colombia is the Andes Mountains, which split into three distinct ranges within the country and shape the climate and settlement patterns. Also, Colombia is the only country in South America that has coast in two Oceans The Atlantic and the Pacific Ocean.</p>
